### Case details
The goal is to write a programm that can guess a number while using as few attempts as possible.

**Conditions:**
- A random number from 0 to 100 is generated and our code needs to guess the number
- The algo checks if the number it is currently checking is higher or lower than the one we're looking for

**Quality metric:**
The results are measured over 1000 rounds

**Practice goal:**
Learning to write good code in Python
