### Case details  
The goal is to write a programm that can guess a number while using as few attempts as possible.  

**Conditions:**  
- A random number from 1 to 100 is generated and our code needs to guess the number 
- The program checks if the number it is currently checking is higher or lower than the one we're looking for  
- The goal is for the program to guess the number in less than 20 attempts

**Quality metric:**  
The results are measured over 1000 rounds, the desired outcome is to use as few attempts as possible per round on average 

**Practice goal:**  
Learning to write good code in Python  
Learning to work with IDE and Github
